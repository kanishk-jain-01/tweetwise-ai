# Product Requirements Document: TweetWiseAI

## Introduction/Overview

TweetWiseAI is a web application designed to help Twitter users write better, more powerful, and concise tweets. The platform combines AI-powered grammar and spell checking with tweet analysis and curation features to enhance users' Twitter content creation experience. Built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, the application provides a modern, sleek interface for crafting high-quality tweets.

**Problem Statement**: Many Twitter users struggle with creating engaging, error-free, and impactful tweets. Current tools either lack Twitter-specific optimization or don't provide comprehensive writing assistance tailored for the platform's unique constraints and culture.

**Solution**: A dedicated platform that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide real-time grammar and spell checking, tweet analysis, and content curation assistance specifically designed for Twitter's format and audience.

## Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Reduce grammar and spelling errors in user tweets by 90%
2. **Secondary Goal**: Improve tweet engagement potential through AI-powered analysis and suggestions
3. **User Experience Goal**: Provide sub-2-second response times for all AI-powered features
4. **Efficiency Goal**: Minimize API costs through intelligent request batching and debouncing
5. **Retention Goal**: Enable users to build a personal tweet library and track their writing improvement over time
