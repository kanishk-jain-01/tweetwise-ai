# Project Brief: TweetWiseAI

## Project Overview

TweetWiseAI is a web application that helps Twitter users write better, more powerful, and concise tweets through AI-powered assistance. The platform combines real-time grammar and spell checking with tweet analysis and curation features to enhance users' Twitter content creation experience.

## Core Problem

Many Twitter users struggle with creating engaging, error-free, and impactful tweets. Current tools either lack Twitter-specific optimization or don't provide comprehensive writing assistance tailored for the platform's unique constraints and culture.

## Solution Approach

A dedicated platform leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide:

- Real-time grammar and spell checking
- Tweet analysis and critique
- Content curation assistance
- Distraction-free writing environment
- Tweet history and draft management

## Key Success Metrics

1. **Primary Goal**: Reduce grammar and spelling errors in user tweets by 90%
2. **Performance Goal**: Sub-2-second response times for all AI-powered features
3. **User Experience Goal**: Provide intuitive three-panel dashboard interface
4. **Efficiency Goal**: Minimize API costs through intelligent request batching

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with App Router, React 18+, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4+ with custom design system
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL for user data and tweet history
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for secure user management
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo for spell check, GPT-4 for grammar/critique)
- **Deployment**: Vercel with Edge Functions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 (MVP - 4-6 weeks)
