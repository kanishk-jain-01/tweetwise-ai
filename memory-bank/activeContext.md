# Active Context: TweetWiseAI

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: Landing Page Complete, Core UI Ready

The project has successfully completed the entire landing page and user onboarding UI. A robust set of core UI components using `shadcn/ui` has been integrated, and the authentication forms have been refactored for a modern user experience. The build is stable, and the foundation is set for building the core application features.

### Immediate Priority: Phase 5.0 Dashboard and Tweet Composer

The focus now shifts to building the main application interface:

1.  **Dashboard Layout**
    *   Create the three-panel responsive layout (History, Composer, AI Suggestions).
    *   Implement collapsible panels for mobile responsiveness.

2.  **Tweet Composer**
    *   Build the central tweet composition component with a textarea.
    *   Implement real-time character count and limit warnings.
    *   Set up auto-save functionality for drafts.

3.  **UI Placeholders**
    *   Develop skeleton components and loading states for a smooth UX.
    *   Create placeholder panels for Tweet History and AI Suggestions.

## Recent Changes and Discoveries

### Technical Debugging & Resolution

1.  **Tailwind CSS Version Conflict**: Successfully diagnosed and resolved a major conflict between Tailwind CSS v4 (initially installed) and `shadcn/ui` (which requires v3).
2.  **Resolution**: The fix involved a complete reset of the Tailwind configuration:
    *   Downgraded Tailwind CSS packages to `~3.4`.
    *   Replaced `postcss.config.mjs` with a standard `postcss.config.js`.
    *   Generated a new, compatible `tailwind.config.ts`.
    *   Reinstalled dependencies after clearing `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`.
    *   This stabilized the build and allowed `shadcn/ui` components to render correctly.

### Key Architectural Decisions Made

1.  **UI Library**: Standardized on `shadcn/ui` for all core components.
2.  **Notifications**: Adopted `sonner` for toast notifications, replacing the deprecated `Toast` component from `shadcn/ui`.
3.  **Form Management**: Established a pattern using `shadcn/ui`'s `Form` component, backed by `react-hook-form` and `zod` for robust, type-safe validation.
4.  **Icons**: Using `lucide-react` for all icon implementations.
5.  **Memory Bank Initialization**: Comprehensive documentation system established
6.  **Three-Panel Layout**: Dashboard design pattern confirmed
7.  **AI Service Strategy**: Separate endpoints for different AI functions
8.  **Database Foundation Complete**: Production-ready schema with 16 optimized indexes
9.  **Environment Configuration**: Complete environment variables template created
10. **Git Repository**: Initial project structure committed with standardized commit messages
11. **Authentication System**: Complete NextAuth.js implementation with security best practices
12. **Database Architecture**: Comprehensive indexing strategy for optimal performance
13. **Query Optimization**: Type-safe database query functions for all operations
14. **Performance Strategy**: Sub-2-second response times with intelligent caching

## Next Steps (Immediate - Next 1-2 Sessions)

### 1. Dashboard and Tweet Composition (CURRENT)

- [ ] Create three-panel dashboard layout.
- [ ] Implement tweet composer with character count.
- [ ] Add auto-save functionality for drafts.
- [ ] Create tweet history and AI suggestions panels (placeholders).
- [ ] Implement loading states and skeleton components.

### 2. AI Integration and Services (NEXT)

- [ ] Set up OpenAI API client with error handling.
- [ ] Implement spell checking service using GPT-3.5-turbo.
- [ ] Integrate with AI_Responses caching system.

### 3. Advanced Features (UPCOMING)

- [ ] Create grammar checking service using GPT-4.
- [ ] Build tweet critique and curation features.
- [ ] Integrate advanced draft management (search, filter).

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending

1.  **State Management**: Determine if a global state manager (like Zustand) is needed for the dashboard, or if component state and props are sufficient.
2.  **Caching Strategy**: Finalize the client-side caching approach for tweet history and drafts.
3.  **Error Boundary Strategy**: Implement comprehensive error handling for the main application.

### Design Decisions Pending

1.  **Loading States**: Finalize the design of skeleton loaders for the dashboard panels.
2.  **Dashboard Polish**: Refine the look and feel of the dashboard components once the layout is functional.

### Integration Considerations

1.  **OpenAI API Limits**: Understand and plan for rate limiting
2.  **Cost Optimization**: Implement efficient request batching and caching
3.  **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
4.  **Performance Monitoring**: Set up tracking for response times and user experience

## Current Blockers and Risks

### Potential Blockers

- **None**. The project is in a stable state, ready for new feature development.

### Risk Mitigation

1.  **API Cost Management**: Implement request debouncing and caching early
2.  **Performance Monitoring**: Set up monitoring from the beginning
3.  **Security Review**: Regular security audits of authentication and data handling
4.  **User Experience Testing**: Early user testing to validate interface decisions

## Development Workflow

### Current Phase: Core Feature Implementation

- Focus on building the primary dashboard and tweet composer.
- Prioritize a functional and responsive user experience.
- Build out foundational components for AI integration.

### Next Phase: AI Services

- Add AI-powered spell and grammar checking.
- Implement tweet critique and analysis features.
- Enhance user experience with advanced interactions.

### Success Criteria for Current Phase

1.  **Dashboard**: A functional three-panel layout is implemented.
2.  **Composition**: Users can write tweets with real-time character count feedback.
3.  **Drafts**: Auto-save functionality works reliably.
4.  **Responsiveness**: The dashboard is usable across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## Communication and Collaboration

### Documentation Updates Needed

- Update progress.md after each major milestone
- Document any architectural changes in systemPatterns.md
- Update techContext.md with new dependencies or configurations

### User Feedback Integration

- Plan for early user testing once MVP is functional
- Establish feedback collection mechanism
- Create process for incorporating user suggestions

This active context will be updated regularly to reflect the current state of development and guide immediate next steps in the TweetWiseAI project.
