# Active Context: TweetWiseAI

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: Dashboard and Tweet Composer Complete

The project has successfully completed the entire dashboard implementation with a professional three-panel layout, responsive design, and full tweet composition functionality. The dashboard provides an app-like experience with conditional layouts, user profile management, and mobile-responsive navigation. The foundation is now ready for AI service integration.

### Immediate Priority: Phase 7.0 AI Integration

The focus now shifts to integrating AI services with the existing dashboard:

1. **OpenAI API Integration**

   - Set up OpenAI client with proper error handling and rate limiting.
   - Implement spell checking service using GPT-3.5-turbo.
   - Connect AI suggestions panel to real AI services.

2. **AI Services Implementation**

   - Grammar checking service with GPT-4.
   - Tweet critique and analysis functionality.
   - Request caching and optimization strategies.

3. **Error Handling & Performance**
   - Comprehensive error boundaries for AI service failures.
   - Response time monitoring and optimization.
   - Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable.

## Recent Changes and Discoveries

### Major Dashboard Implementation (COMPLETED)

1. **Three-Panel Responsive Layout**: Successfully implemented the core dashboard with History, Composer, and AI Suggestions panels that adapt perfectly to all screen sizes.

2. **Tweet Composer with Advanced Features**:

   - Real-time character counting with visual progress ring
   - Color-coded warnings (green → yellow at 90% → red over 280 characters)
   - Auto-save functionality every 30 seconds with visual feedback
   - Debounced input handling (500ms delay) for AI triggers
   - Custom hook `useTweetComposer` for comprehensive state management

3. **Professional Dashboard Header**: Clean header with TweetWiseAI branding and user profile dropdown featuring avatar with initials, user name extraction from email, and proper authentication handling.

4. **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Implemented drawer navigation for mobile devices with smooth animations and full functionality preservation across all screen sizes.

5. **Conditional Layout System**: Created a sophisticated layout system that excludes landing page elements from dashboard pages, providing a true app-like experience.

### Technical Architecture Achievements

1. **Component Architecture**: Established clear separation between features, UI components, and layout components following modern React patterns.

2. **Custom Hooks Strategy**: Implemented `useTweetComposer`, `useTweetHistory`, and `useAISuggestions` hooks for clean state management and reusability.

3. **TypeScript Integration**: Fixed all TypeScript errors and established proper type safety throughout the dashboard components.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Implemented debounced inputs, optimistic updates, and efficient re-rendering strategies.

5. **Mobile UX Excellence**: Created smooth drawer animations and maintained full functionality on mobile devices without compromise.

### Key Architectural Decisions Made

1. **Dashboard Layout Pattern**: Three-panel fixed layout with responsive collapsing
2. **User Profile Management**: Dropdown-based profile system with NextAuth integration
3. **Mobile Navigation**: Header-based drawer system for side panel access
4. **Character Counting**: Real-time visual feedback with color-coded warnings
5. **Auto-Save Strategy**: 30-second intervals with visual feedback and error handling
6. **State Management**: Custom hooks pattern for feature-specific state
7. **Loading States**: Comprehensive skeleton components and loading indicators
8. **Error Boundaries**: Prepared infrastructure for AI service error handling

## Next Steps (Immediate - Next 1-2 Sessions)

- [ ] Create structured response parsing for grammar suggestions
- [ ] Integrate grammar checking with the AI suggestions panel
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for AI response times

### 3. Tweet Critique Feature (UPCOMING)

- [ ] Build tweet critique service for engagement analysis
- [ ] Create conversational AI interface for tweet improvement suggestions
- [ ] Implement caching system for AI responses to optimize costs
- [ ] Add batch processing capabilities for multiple tweets

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending

1. **AI Response Caching**: Determine optimal caching strategy (Redis vs. database vs. memory)
2. **Error Handling Strategy**: Implement comprehensive error boundaries for AI service failures
3. **Rate Limiting**: Plan for OpenAI API rate limits and cost optimization
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up tracking for AI service response times and success rates

### Design Decisions Pending

1. **AI Suggestions UI**: Finalize the design of AI feedback presentation in the right panel
2. **Error States**: Design user-friendly error messages for AI service failures
3. **Loading Indicators**: Implement AI-specific loading states and progress indicators

### Integration Considerations

1. **OpenAI API Costs**: Implement efficient request batching and caching to minimize costs
2. **Response Time Optimization**: Target sub-2-second response times for all AI services
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure dashboard remains functional when AI services fail
4. **User Experience**: Maintain smooth interactions even during AI processing delays

## Current Blockers and Risks

### Potential Blockers

- **None**. Dashboard is complete and stable, ready for AI integration.

### Risk Mitigation

1. **API Cost Management**: Implement request debouncing, caching, and usage monitoring from day one
2. **Service Reliability**: Build robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
3. **Performance Impact**: Monitor AI service response times and optimize accordingly
4. **User Experience**: Ensure AI features enhance rather than slow down the core experience

## Development Workflow

### Current Phase: AI Services Integration

- Focus on connecting the existing dashboard to OpenAI services
- Prioritize spell checking as the foundational AI feature
- Build robust error handling and performance monitoring
- Maintain the excellent user experience established in the dashboard

### Next Phase: Advanced AI Features

- Expand to grammar checking and tweet critique features
- Implement advanced caching and optimization strategies
- Add batch processing and advanced AI workflows
- Enhance user experience with sophisticated AI interactions

### Success Criteria for Current Phase

1. **Spell Checking**: Users can get real-time spell checking suggestions in the AI panel
2. **Performance**: AI services respond within 2 seconds consistently
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
4. **User Experience**: AI features feel integrated and natural within the dashboard

## Communication and Collaboration

### Documentation Updates Needed
