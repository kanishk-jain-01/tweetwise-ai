# Active Context: TweetWiseAI

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: Authentication Complete, Database Setup Phase
The project has completed the authentication system implementation and is ready to move into database setup. A comprehensive authentication system with NextAuth.js, password reset, and route protection is now fully functional.

### Immediate Priority: Phase 3.0 Database Setup
Focus on implementing the database foundation for the application:

1. **Database Connection Setup**
   - Neon PostgreSQL connection and configuration
   - Environment variables and connection testing
   - Database client setup and optimization

2. **Database Schema Creation**
   - Users table with authentication fields
   - Tweets table with draft/completed status
   - AI responses table for caching
   - Proper relationships and constraints

3. **Database Utilities**
   - Query functions for user operations
   - Tweet CRUD operations
   - AI response caching functions
   - Performance indexing

4. **Schema Testing and Validation**
   - Test database connectivity
   - Validate schema relationships
   - Performance testing for queries

## Recent Changes and Discoveries

### Codebase Analysis Findings
1. **Existing Structure**: Basic Next.js 15.3.4 setup with App Router
2. **Component Organization**: Feature-based component structure already outlined
3. **Technology Stack**: Modern stack with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4+
4. **Dependencies**: All major dependencies already installed and configured

### Key Architectural Decisions Made
1. **Memory Bank Initialization**: Comprehensive documentation system established
2. **Three-Panel Layout**: Dashboard design pattern confirmed
3. **AI Service Strategy**: Separate endpoints for different AI functions
4. **Database Schema**: Core entities defined (users, tweets, ai_responses)
5. **Environment Configuration**: Complete environment variables template created
6. **Git Repository**: Initial project structure committed with standardized commit messages
7. **Authentication System**: Complete NextAuth.js implementation with security best practices
8. **Task List Reorganization**: Added landing page as Phase 4.0, updated all subsequent phases
9. **UI Component Strategy**: Decided on shadcn/ui for Phase 5.0 design system

## Next Steps (Immediate - Next 1-2 Sessions)

### 1. Database Setup and Schema Implementation (CURRENT)
- [ ] Set up Neon PostgreSQL connection
- [ ] Create database schema with proper migrations  
- [ ] Implement database utility functions
- [ ] Test database connectivity

### 2. Landing Page Development (NEXT)
- [ ] Create compelling hero section with value proposition
- [ ] Add features showcase highlighting AI benefits
- [ ] Implement clear CTAs for sign up/sign in
- [ ] Build responsive navigation and footer

### 3. UI Components with shadcn/ui (UPCOMING)
- [ ] Install and configure shadcn/ui
- [ ] Set up core components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- [ ] Customize theme with TweetWiseAI branding
- [ ] Retrofit existing auth components

### 4. Tweet Composition and Dashboard (FUTURE)
- [ ] Create three-panel dashboard layout
- [ ] Implement tweet composer with character count
- [ ] Add auto-save functionality for drafts
- [ ] Create tweet history and AI suggestions panels

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending
1. **Caching Strategy**: Decide between Redis or in-memory caching for AI responses
2. **State Management**: Determine if additional state management (Zustand/Redux) is needed
3. **Error Boundary Strategy**: Implement comprehensive error handling approach
4. **Testing Strategy**: Establish testing patterns for AI integrations

### Design Decisions Pending
1. **Color Scheme**: Finalize the design system and color palette
2. **Typography**: Confirm font sizes and spacing for optimal readability
3. **Mobile Experience**: Detailed mobile layout and interaction patterns
4. **Loading States**: Design loading indicators for AI operations

### Integration Considerations
1. **OpenAI API Limits**: Understand and plan for rate limiting
2. **Cost Optimization**: Implement efficient request batching and caching
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up tracking for response times and user experience

## Current Blockers and Risks

### Potential Blockers
1. **Environment Setup**: Need to configure environment variables for database and AI services
2. **Database Access**: Require Neon PostgreSQL setup and connection string
3. **OpenAI API Key**: Need valid API key for AI service integration
4. **Deployment Configuration**: Vercel setup for staging and production environments

### Risk Mitigation
1. **API Cost Management**: Implement request debouncing and caching early
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up monitoring from the beginning
3. **Security Review**: Regular security audits of authentication and data handling
4. **User Experience Testing**: Early user testing to validate interface decisions

## Development Workflow

### Current Phase: Foundation Building
- Focus on core infrastructure and basic functionality
- Prioritize stability and security over advanced features
- Establish patterns that will scale with future development

### Next Phase: Feature Implementation
- Add AI-powered spell and grammar checking
- Implement tweet critique and analysis features
- Enhance user experience with advanced interactions

### Success Criteria for Current Phase
1. **Authentication**: Users can register, login, and maintain sessions
2. **Basic Composition**: Users can write tweets with character count feedback
3. **Draft Management**: Users can save and retrieve drafts
4. **AI Integration**: Basic spell checking functionality working
5. **Responsive Design**: Interface works across desktop, tablet, and mobile

## Communication and Collaboration

### Documentation Updates Needed
- Update progress.md after each major milestone
- Document any architectural changes in systemPatterns.md
- Update techContext.md with new dependencies or configurations

### User Feedback Integration
- Plan for early user testing once MVP is functional
- Establish feedback collection mechanism
- Create process for incorporating user suggestions

This active context will be updated regularly to reflect the current state of development and guide immediate next steps in the TweetWiseAI project.
