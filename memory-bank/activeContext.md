## Recent Changes and Discoveries

### AI Spell Check Race Condition Fixes (COMPLETED)

1.  **Request Cancellation**: Implemented AbortController to cancel ongoing requests when new ones are triggered, preventing overlapping API calls and out-of-order responses.

2.  **Suggestion Acceptance Flow**: Removed immediate re-analysis after accepting suggestions to prevent race conditions. Added a flag system to prevent debounced effects from triggering during suggestion application.

3.  **Stable useEffect Dependencies**: Memoized suggestion functions to prevent unnecessary effect re-runs and stabilized the debounced spell check effect.

4.  **Improved AI Prompt**: Enhanced the spell check prompt with specific rules for social media content, reducing false positives and inconsistent suggestions for word variations like "love" vs "loving".

5.  **Better Text Replacement**: Improved word boundary detection using regex to prevent partial word matches during suggestion application.

### Key Technical Improvements Made

1.  **AbortController Integration**: All spell check requests can now be cancelled, preventing race conditions from overlapping requests.
2.  **Suggestion Application Flag**: Added `isApplyingSuggestionRef` to prevent debounced effects during suggestion acceptance.
3.  **Enhanced AI Prompt**: More specific rules for social media content, with clear examples of what to flag vs. ignore.
4.  **Robust Text Replacement**: Word boundary detection to ensure accurate text replacement.
5.  **Stable Function References**: Proper memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders and effect triggers.

### AI Integration & Dashboard Refactor (COMPLETED)

1.  **OpenAI Client & API Route**: Successfully set up the OpenAI client and created the `/api/ai/spell-check/route.ts` endpoint. The API uses Zod for validation and provides structured JSON responses.

2.  **Dashboard State Refactor**: The main dashboard page (`/dashboard/page.tsx`) was converted to a client component to manage shared state. State from `useTweetComposer` and `useAISuggestions` was lifted into this parent component.

3.  **Controlled Components**: `TweetComposer`, `AISuggestions`, and `TweetHistory` were refactored into controlled components that receive data and handlers via props. This decouples them from their hooks and allows for centralized state management.

4.  **Debounced AI Requests**: A `useDebounce` hook was created and implemented. The application now waits for the user to pause typing before sending the content to the spell-check API, optimizing performance and reducing cost.

5.  **End-to-End Spell Check**: The full loop is complete and stable: user types in composer -> content is debounced -> API is called -> suggestions are returned -> suggestions are displayed in the UI -> suggestions can be accepted without causing loops.

### Key Architectural Decisions Made

1.  **Request Cancellation Pattern**: Implemented AbortController pattern for all AI requests to prevent race conditions.
2.  **Lifted State Management**: The dashboard uses a "lift state up" pattern for communication between its panels.
3.  **In-Memory Caching**: A simple `Map`-based in-memory cache was implemented on the API route for rapid development.
4.  **Prop-Driven Components**: Feature components are now "dumb" and controlled by the parent dashboard page.
5.  **Conservative AI Prompting**: Enhanced prompts with specific rules to reduce false positives and improve consistency.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending

1.  **AI Response Caching**: Decide on a production-ready caching strategy (Redis vs. database). The current in-memory cache is not suitable for a scaled application.
2.  **Error Handling Strategy**: Implement component-level error boundaries around the AI panel to handle API failures gracefully without crashing the entire dashboard.
3.  **State Management Library**: If more cross-component state is needed, evaluate a lightweight state management library like Zustand to avoid excessive prop drilling.

### Design Decisions Pending

1.  **AI Suggestions UI**: Finalize the design for how multiple types of suggestions (spelling, grammar) are displayed together.
2.  **Loading Indicators**: Differentiate loading states between initial analysis, spell check, and grammar checks.

### Integration Considerations

1. **OpenAI API Costs**: Implement efficient request batching and caching to minimize costs
2. **Response Time Optimization**: Target sub-2-second response times for all AI services
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure dashboard remains functional when AI services fail
