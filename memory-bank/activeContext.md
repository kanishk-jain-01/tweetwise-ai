- [ ] Implement spell checking service using GPT-3.5-turbo
- [ ] Create grammar checking service using GPT-4
- [ ] Build tweet critique and curation features
- [ ] Integrate with AI_Responses caching system

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending

1. **Caching Strategy**: Decide between Redis or in-memory caching for AI responses
2. **State Management**: Determine if additional state management (Zustand/Redux) is needed
3. **Error Boundary Strategy**: Implement comprehensive error handling approach
4. **Testing Strategy**: Establish testing patterns for AI integrations

### Design Decisions Pending

1. **Color Scheme**: Finalize the design system and color palette
2. **Typography**: Confirm font sizes and spacing for optimal readability
3. **Mobile Experience**: Detailed mobile layout and interaction patterns
4. **Loading States**: Design loading indicators for AI operations

### Integration Considerations

1. **OpenAI API Limits**: Understand and plan for rate limiting
2. **Cost Optimization**: Implement efficient request batching and caching
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up tracking for response times and user experience

## Current Blockers and Risks

### Potential Blockers

1. **Environment Setup**: Need to configure environment variables for database and AI services
2. **Database Access**: Require Neon PostgreSQL setup and connection string
3. **OpenAI API Key**: Need valid API key for AI service integration
4. **Deployment Configuration**: Vercel setup for staging and production environments

### Risk Mitigation

1. **API Cost Management**: Implement request debouncing and caching early
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up monitoring from the beginning
3. **Security Review**: Regular security audits of authentication and data handling
4. **User Experience Testing**: Early user testing to validate interface decisions

## Development Workflow

### Current Phase: Foundation Building

- Focus on core infrastructure and basic functionality
- Prioritize stability and security over advanced features
- Establish patterns that will scale with future development

### Next Phase: Feature Implementation

- Add AI-powered spell and grammar checking
- Implement tweet critique and analysis features
- Enhance user experience with advanced interactions

### Success Criteria for Current Phase

1. **Authentication**: Users can register, login, and maintain sessions
2. **Basic Composition**: Users can write tweets with character count feedback
3. **Draft Management**: Users can save and retrieve drafts
4. **AI Integration**: Basic spell checking functionality working
5. **Responsive Design**: Interface works across desktop, tablet, and mobile

## Communication and Collaboration

### Documentation Updates Needed

- Update progress.md after each major milestone
- Document any architectural changes in systemPatterns.md
- Update techContext.md with new dependencies or configurations

### User Feedback Integration

- Plan for early user testing once MVP is functional
- Establish feedback collection mechanism
- Create process for incorporating user suggestions

This active context will be updated regularly to reflect the current state of development and guide immediate next steps in the TweetWiseAI project.
