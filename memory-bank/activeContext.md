## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: TWITTER API AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE, API ENDPOINTS NEXT

The AI assistance system (writing check, critique) has been successfully completed and optimized. We have now completed the Twitter API authentication infrastructure and are ready to implement the API endpoints for posting and scheduling tweets.

### Immediate Priority: Twitter API Endpoints (Task 3.0)

With the AI services foundation and Twitter authentication system complete, we're now building the API endpoints that will enable users to actually post and schedule tweets directly from the application.

1.  **Writing Check Service** ✅ **COMPLETED & OPTIMIZED**

    - ✅ **Consolidated Endpoint**: Created `/api/ai/writing-check` that handles both spelling and grammar
    - ✅ **Enhanced AI Analysis**: Single GPT-4 call analyzes both spelling and grammar in context
    - ✅ **Improved Performance**: ~50% faster (one API call vs two concurrent calls)
    - ✅ **Better Cost Efficiency**: Single GPT-4 request instead of GPT-3.5 + GPT-4
    - ✅ **Smart Response Filtering**: API returns tagged suggestions, UI filters by type
    - ✅ **Same Great UX**: Red badges for spelling, yellow for grammar - no user-facing changes
    - ✅ **Race Condition Prevention**: Maintained all existing AbortController patterns

2.  **Tweet Critique Feature** ✅ **COMPLETED**

    - ✅ **Critique API Service**: Created `/api/ai/critique` endpoint using GPT-4 for engagement analysis
    - ✅ **Comprehensive Analysis**: Analyzes engagement score (1-10), clarity (1-10), tone, and provides actionable suggestions
    - ✅ **Twitter-Specific Optimization**: Specialized prompts for Twitter engagement tactics and best practices
    - ✅ **Race Condition Prevention**: Implemented AbortController pattern consistent with other AI services
    - ✅ **Robust Error Handling**: Structured response validation with fallback critique on parsing errors
    - ✅ **Response Caching**: In-memory caching system for critique results to optimize API costs
    - ✅ **UI Integration**: Fully integrated with existing AISuggestions component and dashboard workflow
    - ✅ **Authentication Protected**: Properly secured behind authentication middleware

3.  **Twitter API Authentication System** ✅ **COMPLETED**

    - ✅ **Database Infrastructure**: Extended schema with Twitter-specific fields (scheduled_for, tweet_id, sent_at, error_message)
    - ✅ **Migration System**: Complete database migration system with rollback capabilities and twitter_tokens table
    - ✅ **Twitter Queries**: Comprehensive TwitterQueries class with 15+ specialized methods for scheduling, posting, and management
    - ✅ **Package Installation**: twitter-api-v2 library installed and configured
    - ✅ **Type Definitions**: Complete TypeScript interfaces for Twitter API responses and OAuth flow
    - ✅ **Twitter API Client**: Comprehensive TwitterClient class with OAuth 2.0 PKCE support, tweet posting, and error handling
    - ✅ **OAuth 2.0 Flow**: Complete OAuth authentication flow with secure state management and token storage
    - ✅ **Token Management**: Secure token validation, refresh, and cleanup with TwitterTokenManager service
    - ✅ **Environment Configuration**: Twitter OAuth credentials added to environment variables with documentation

    - ✅ **UI Components**: Complete TwitterConnect components for connecting/disconnecting accounts with multiple display modes

4.  **Twitter API Endpoints** 🚧 **NEXT PRIORITY**

    - ⏳ **OAuth API Routes**: Create `/api/twitter/auth`, `/api/twitter/callback`, `/api/twitter/status`, `/api/twitter/disconnect` endpoints
    - ⏳ **Tweet Posting**: Create `/api/twitter/post` endpoint for immediate tweet posting
    - ⏳ **Tweet Scheduling**: Create `/api/twitter/schedule` endpoint for scheduling tweets
    - ⏳ **Request Validation**: Implement Zod schemas for all Twitter API endpoints
    - ⏳ **Authentication Middleware**: Ensure all endpoints are properly secured

## Recent Changes and Discoveries

### AI Spell Check Race Condition Fixes (COMPLETED)

1.  **Request Cancellation**: Implemented AbortController to cancel ongoing requests when new ones are triggered, preventing overlapping API calls and out-of-order responses.

2.  **Suggestion Acceptance Flow**: Removed immediate re-analysis after accepting suggestions to prevent race conditions. Added a flag system to prevent debounced effects from triggering during suggestion application.

3.  **Stable useEffect Dependencies**: Memoized suggestion functions to prevent unnecessary effect re-runs and stabilized the debounced spell check effect.

4.  **Improved AI Prompt**: Enhanced the spell check prompt with specific rules for social media content, reducing false positives and inconsistent suggestions for word variations like "love" vs "loving".

5.  **Better Text Replacement**: Improved word boundary detection using regex to prevent partial word matches during suggestion application.

### Key Technical Improvements Made

1.  **AbortController Integration**: All spell check requests can now be cancelled, preventing race conditions from overlapping requests.
2.  **Suggestion Application Flag**: Added `isApplyingSuggestionRef` to prevent debounced effects during suggestion acceptance.
3.  **Enhanced AI Prompt**: More specific rules for social media content, with clear examples of what to flag vs. ignore.
4.  **Robust Text Replacement**: Word boundary detection to ensure accurate text replacement.
5.  **Stable Function References**: Proper memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders and effect triggers.

### AI Integration & Dashboard Refactor (COMPLETED)

1.  **OpenAI Client & API Route**: Successfully set up the OpenAI client and created the `/api/ai/spell-check/route.ts` endpoint. The API uses Zod for validation and provides structured JSON responses.

2.  **Dashboard State Refactor**: The main dashboard page (`/dashboard/page.tsx`) was converted to a client component to manage shared state. State from `useTweetComposer` and `useAISuggestions` was lifted into this parent component.

3.  **Controlled Components**: `TweetComposer`, `AISuggestions`, and `TweetHistory` were refactored into controlled components that receive data and handlers via props. This decouples them from their hooks and allows for centralized state management.

4.  **Debounced AI Requests**: A `useDebounce` hook was created and implemented. The application now waits for the user to pause typing before sending the content to the spell-check API, optimizing performance and reducing cost.

5.  **End-to-End Spell Check**: The full loop is complete and stable: user types in composer -> content is debounced -> API is called -> suggestions are returned -> suggestions are displayed in the UI -> suggestions can be accepted without causing loops.

### Key Architectural Decisions Made

1.  **Request Cancellation Pattern**: Implemented AbortController pattern for all AI requests to prevent race conditions.
2.  **Lifted State Management**: The dashboard uses a "lift state up" pattern for communication between its panels.
3.  **In-Memory Caching**: A simple `Map`-based in-memory cache was implemented on the API route for rapid development.
4.  **Prop-Driven Components**: Feature components are now "dumb" and controlled by the parent dashboard page.
5.  **Conservative AI Prompting**: Enhanced prompts with specific rules to reduce false positives and improve consistency.

2.  **Error Handling Strategy**: Implement component-level error boundaries around the AI panel to handle API failures gracefully without crashing the entire dashboard.
3.  **State Management Library**: If more cross-component state is needed, evaluate a lightweight state management library like Zustand to avoid excessive prop drilling.

### Design Decisions Pending

1.  **AI Suggestions UI**: Finalize the design for how multiple types of suggestions (spelling, grammar) are displayed together.
2.  **Loading Indicators**: Differentiate loading states between initial analysis, spell check, and grammar checks.

### Integration Considerations

1. **OpenAI API Costs**: Implement efficient request batching and caching to minimize costs
2. **Response Time Optimization**: Target sub-2-second response times for all AI services
