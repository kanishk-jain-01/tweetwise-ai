# Active Context: TweetWiseAI

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status: AI Spell Check Feature Complete

The first AI feature, real-time spell checking, is now fully integrated. The dashboard's state management has been refactored to support communication between the Tweet Composer and the AI Suggestions panel. The system now successfully sends debounced requests to the backend, receives spelling suggestions, and displays them to the user.

### Immediate Priority: Phase 7.0 AI Integration (Continued)

The focus remains on integrating AI services. With the spell check foundation in place, the next steps are to build upon it.

1.  **Grammar Checking Service**

    - Implement the grammar checking API endpoint using GPT-4.
    - Integrate grammar suggestions into the `AISuggestions` panel.

2.  **Error Handling & Performance**
    - Implement comprehensive error boundaries for the dashboard.
    - Enhance the caching strategy (e.g., move from in-memory to Redis).

## Recent Changes and Discoveries

### AI Integration & Dashboard Refactor (COMPLETED)

1.  **OpenAI Client & API Route**: Successfully set up the OpenAI client and created the `/api/ai/spell-check/route.ts` endpoint. The API uses Zod for validation and provides structured JSON responses.

2.  **Dashboard State Refactor**: The main dashboard page (`/dashboard/page.tsx`) was converted to a client component to manage shared state. State from `useTweetComposer` and `useAISuggestions` was lifted into this parent component.

3.  **Controlled Components**: `TweetComposer`, `AISuggestions`, and `TweetHistory` were refactored into controlled components that receive data and handlers via props. This decouples them from their hooks and allows for centralized state management.

4.  **Debounced AI Requests**: A `useDebounce` hook was created and implemented. The application now waits for the user to pause typing before sending the content to the spell-check API, optimizing performance and reducing cost.

5.  **End-to-End Spell Check**: The full loop is complete: user types in composer -> content is debounced -> API is called -> suggestions are returned -> suggestions are displayed in the UI.

### Key Architectural Decisions Made

1.  **Lifted State Management**: The dashboard now uses a "lift state up" pattern for communication between its panels. This is a standard React pattern that works well for the current level of complexity.
2.  **In-Memory Caching**: A simple `Map`-based in-memory cache was implemented on the API route for rapid development. This should be upgraded for production.
3.  **Prop-Driven Components**: Feature components are now "dumb" and controlled by the parent dashboard page, making the component architecture cleaner and more predictable.

## Next Steps (Immediate - Next 1-2 Sessions)

### 1. Grammar Checking Service (CURRENT PRIORITY)

- [ ] Implement grammar checking API endpoint (`/api/ai/grammar-check`) using GPT-4.
- [ ] Create a prompt that returns structured JSON for grammar suggestions.
- [ ] Update `useAISuggestions` hook to fetch and manage grammar suggestions.
- [ ] Display grammar suggestions in the `AISuggestions` panel.

### 2. Tweet Critique Feature (NEXT)

- [ ] Build tweet critique service for engagement analysis
- [ ] Create conversational AI interface for tweet improvement suggestions
- [ ] Implement caching system for AI responses to optimize costs
- [ ] Add batch processing capabilities for multiple tweets

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending

1.  **AI Response Caching**: Decide on a production-ready caching strategy (Redis vs. database). The current in-memory cache is not suitable for a scaled application.
2.  **Error Handling Strategy**: Implement component-level error boundaries around the AI panel to handle API failures gracefully without crashing the entire dashboard.
3.  **State Management Library**: If more cross-component state is needed, evaluate a lightweight state management library like Zustand to avoid excessive prop drilling.

### Design Decisions Pending

1.  **AI Suggestions UI**: Finalize the design for how multiple types of suggestions (spelling, grammar) are displayed together.
2.  **Loading Indicators**: Differentiate loading states between initial analysis, spell check, and grammar checks.

3.  **Dashboard Layout Pattern**: Three-panel fixed layout with responsive collapsing
4.  **User Profile Management**: Dropdown-based profile system with NextAuth integration
5.  **Mobile Navigation**: Header-based drawer system for side panel access
6.  **Character Counting**: Real-time visual feedback with color-coded warnings
7.  **Auto-Save Strategy**: 30-second intervals with visual feedback and error handling
8.  **State Management**: Custom hooks pattern for feature-specific state
9.  **Loading States**: Comprehensive skeleton components and loading indicators
10. **Error Boundaries**: Prepared infrastructure for AI service error handling

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Pending

1. **AI Response Caching**: Determine optimal caching strategy (Redis vs. database vs. memory)
2. **Error Handling Strategy**: Implement comprehensive error boundaries for AI service failures
3. **Rate Limiting**: Plan for OpenAI API rate limits and cost optimization
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up tracking for AI service response times and success rates

### Design Decisions Pending

### Integration Considerations

1. **OpenAI API Costs**: Implement efficient request batching and caching to minimize costs
2. **Response Time Optimization**: Target sub-2-second response times for all AI services
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure dashboard remains functional when AI services fail
4. **User Experience**: Maintain smooth interactions even during AI processing delays

2. **Service Reliability**: Build robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
3. **Performance Impact**: Monitor AI service response times and optimize accordingly
4. **User Experience**: Ensure AI features enhance rather than slow down the core experience

## Development Workflow

### Current Phase: AI Services Integration

- Focus on connecting the existing dashboard to OpenAI services
- Prioritize spell checking as the foundational AI feature
- Build robust error handling and performance monitoring
- Maintain the excellent user experience established in the dashboard

### Next Phase: Advanced AI Features

4. **User Experience**: AI features feel integrated and natural within the dashboard

## Communication and Collaboration

### Documentation Updates Needed

- Update systemPatterns.md with AI integration architecture
- Document AI service patterns and error handling strategies
- Update techContext.md with OpenAI integration details

### User Feedback Integration

- Prepare for user testing of AI features once implemented
- Plan feedback collection mechanism for AI suggestion quality
- Create process for iterating on AI service effectiveness

This active context reflects the successful completion of the dashboard implementation and the shift in focus toward AI service integration, which represents the next major milestone in the TweetWiseAI project.
