# Product Context: TweetWiseAI

## Why This Project Exists

### The Twitter Writing Challenge

Twitter's unique format creates specific challenges for content creators:

- **280-character limit** requires concise, impactful writing
- **Real-time nature** demands quick, error-free composition
- **Public visibility** makes grammar and spelling errors embarrassing
- **Engagement focus** requires understanding of tone and clarity
- **Distraction-heavy environment** on Twitter makes focused writing difficult

### Current Tool Limitations

Existing solutions fail to address Twitter's specific needs:

- Generic grammar checkers don't understand Twitter's informal tone
- No tools provide Twitter-specific engagement analysis
